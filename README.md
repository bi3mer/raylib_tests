# Raylib Tests

This repo has a bunch of tests and experiments with [raylib](https://www.raylib.com/). The purpose is to make small games and simulations that are either interesting to me, fun, or help me learning something new about the library. Each directory in this repo is one of those experiments.

## Ideas

### Simulations

- Conway's game of life
- Boids
- Falling sand
- Hilbert Curves
- Ant Colony
- N-body

### Games

- Pong
- Snake
- Tic-Tac-Toe
- Pac-man
- Asteroids
- Frogger
- Doodle jump
